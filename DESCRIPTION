Description: Simulate routing within a 'shiny' application by observering
    and reacting to URI changes. 'shiny' applications are considered single page
    applications. 'blaze' makes use of the hash portion of a URI to simulate
    multiple pages within an application. Notably, this allows a browser's
    forward and back buttons to navigate through a 'shiny' application.
